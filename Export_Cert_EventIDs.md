# Certificate Export Script Event ID Information

This document lists all Event IDs defined in the `Export_Cert_CCS_Secure_Define.ps1` script, along with their associated log levels and event information. These events are logged to both a file (`C:\Logs\CertificateExport_<timestamp>.log`) and the Windows Event Log (Application log, source: `CertificateExport`). The Event IDs are aligned with the `Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System/Operational` log, starting from 1001.

## Notes
- **Event ID Range**: The Event IDs range from 1001 to 1076, aligned with the `Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System/Operational` log's context, starting from 1001 to reflect certificate lifecycle events.
- **Log Levels**: Events are categorized as `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`, indicating the severity of the action or issue.
- **Event Information**: Each event describes specific actions or issues, such as directory creation, certificate monitoring, export processes, backup management, log file housekeeping, and error conditions.
- **Logging Destinations**: All events are logged to both the file at `C:\Logs\CertificateExport_<timestamp>.log` and the Windows Event Log (Application log, source: `CertificateExport`).
- **Housekeeping**: Events 1067–1069 manage the retention of `CertificateExport_*.log` files, keeping only the latest 5 files (configurable via `$maxLogFiles`).
- **Certificate Monitoring**: Events 1070–1076 cover certificate expiration and validity checks, providing status details for each certificate in the store.
